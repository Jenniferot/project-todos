# Project Todos

A ToDo-list that list todo-tasks. Marked as complete or uncomplete with a counter. Duedate and categories can be choosen. The list can be filtered by category.

## The problem

This project is built in react and redux. I planned which components to use and made a sketch of how the list would show up. Installed required dependencies, such as moment, a datepicker, styled components and redux toolkit. I used useSelector to read from the store and dispatched actions from the components to the reducer and store. I checked out redux devtools along the way. 

 If I had more time I would have: 
 1. added local storage
 2. used styled components
 3. styled the dropdown input fields
 4. styled the datepicker
 5. made it responsive for bigger screens
