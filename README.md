# Project Todos

A ToDo-list that list todo-tasks. Marked as complete or uncomplete with a counter. Duedate and categories can be choosen. The list can be filtered by category.

## The problem

This project is built in react and redux. I planned which components to use and made a sketch of how the list would show up. Installed required dependencies, such as moment, a datepicker, styled components and redux toolkit  

 If you had more time I would have: 
 1. added local storage
 2. used styled components
 3. styled the dropdown input fields
 4. styled the datepicker

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
